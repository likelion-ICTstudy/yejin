/*
* Greedy 란
*
* Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece,
* always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
* So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.
*
* For example consider the Fractional Knapsack Problem.
* The local optimal strategy is to choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio. T
* his strategy also leads to a globally optimal solution because we are allowed to take fractions of an item.
